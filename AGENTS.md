For all AI agents working on **z3dk** (~/src/hobby/z3dk):

1.  **Read First:** Check `GEMINI.md` for build and test instructions.
2.  **Context:** Use the `.context/` folder structure.
3.  **Build:** Use `run_tests.sh` to verify disassembly integrity.
4.  **LSP:** key tool: `z3lsp`. Supports Rename, Jump to Def, and error suppression for includes.
5.  **Purpose:** This repo is used for Zelda3 Disassembly and Development Kit tools.
